# Purpose

Chapter 1 contains mostly theoretical knowledge on the domain of Reinforcement Learning. I will be noting down the most important observations/concepts that I've taken down in my physical notebook in this document.

# Lessons

1. Purpose of RL is to maximize reward, not to find some hidden structure. 
2. Exploration vs exploitation tradeoff- the need to explore something new but this may come at cost of exploitation, which means we are not able to maximize the reward in current state.

# Definitions
1. Policy- action to be derived from current state.
2. Value function takes advantage of information available during the course of play.
(Other terminologies are mostly omitted due to the ease of understanding them.)
